But that’s not where our story begins.

When my brother and I stepped into the Department of Computer Science four years ago, we had one goal:
𝗧𝗼 𝘄𝗶𝗻.

Not just in academics, but in life.

Fast forward to today, we not only graduated in the top 1% of our class, but also stepped into the industry with three years of hands-on experience.

Because while many students focus solely on grades, we chose a different path.

We didn’t just attend lectures and cram for exams.
We built apps.
We designed systems.
We worked on projects for school clubs and startups.

So, 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝘄𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗱𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱, we weren’t just students with a degree. 𝗪𝗲 𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮 𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗼.

𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞’𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐡:

We didn’t love school. 😂😭
But we loved the challenge.

We weren’t motivated by the system; we were motivated by the idea that we could master both academics and real-world skills at the same time.

And we did.

You don’t have to pick one. You can do both.

It’s not about time—it’s about priorities.

1️⃣ 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗰𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮 𝗯𝘂𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗻.
We saw school as a challenge, not a chore. This mindset shift changed everything.

2️⃣ 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆
Waiting until graduation to gain experience is a mistake. Get your hands dirty now.

3️⃣ 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲.
We pushed each other to grow, and we built better things together. Find people who challenge you.

4️⃣ 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.
If you don’t control your schedule, it will control you. Learn to prioritize.

5️⃣ 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘆 𝗵𝘂𝗻𝗴𝗿𝘆, 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘆 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀.
Tech evolves fast. The only way to stay relevant is to keep learning.

𝐒𝐨, 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭’𝐬 𝐧𝐞𝐱𝐭?

We’re just getting started.

Graduation isn’t the finish line—it’s the launchpad.
